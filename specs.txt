Hobot is a tool to help people trying develop Android applications
in a low memory environment.

Android apps can be developed without Android Studio. We know the IDE
can be really useful with all that code generation and templates, but
sometimes what you need is just a simple tool to use in your low memory
computer, and here cames Hobot.

This is a brand new project and its development start today. I hope
I can find time to develop all the tools and features in my mind.

Thx
